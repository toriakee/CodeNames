CodeNames Board Game built in Java

The game is built upon a client-server connection, allowing multiple players to compete against each other and chat using a ChatBox function embedded within the game across the server. 

The game is connected to a database; functions include Log in and Register (user is then added to the database). The database also contains words to populate the board for the game, a method is included to populate the board at random.

The aim of the game is for the Player to correctly select the red tiles, directed via the SpyMaster (who can see the associated colours on the board). 

The game is won when all red tiles are selected. Game Over if a yellow tile is selected.
